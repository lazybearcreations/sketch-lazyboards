# lazyboards

Sketch Plugin written in Cocoascript to enhance the functionality of Artboards within Sketch.

_This plugin was created using `skpm`. For a detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [skpm Readme](https://github.com/skpm/skpm/blob/master/README.md)._

## Wrap in square Artboard

Wrap will take all the layer in your selection and wrap them in a square Artboard with a width and height based on the longest side of the longest layer, then centers layers in the Artboard that wraps them.

## Duplicate to all Artboards

Duplicate will take the selected layers and duplicate them to all Artboards on the same page.
